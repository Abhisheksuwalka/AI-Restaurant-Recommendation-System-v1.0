- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average prediction error
- **Precision/Recall/F1-Score**: Classification performance
- **Coverage**: Percentage of items that can be recommended
- **Diversity**: Variety in recommendations

### 2. Speed & Scalability Metrics:

- **Training Time**: Time to train each model component
- **Prediction Latency**: Time to generate recommendations
- **Throughput**: Recommendations per second
- **Memory Usage**: RAM consumption during operations
- **Concurrent User Capacity**: Estimated concurrent user support

### 3. Business Value Metrics:

- **User Satisfaction**: Simulated user rating of recommendations
- **Novelty**: How unique/surprising recommendations are
- **Serendipity**: Pleasant unexpected discoveries
- **Click-Through Rate**: Estimated user engagement
- **Conversion Rate**: Estimated booking/order rates

### 4. Emotional Intelligence Metrics:
